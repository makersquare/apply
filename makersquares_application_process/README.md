# MakerSquare's Application Process

There are 5 components to the application process at MakerSquare. The entire process can take anywhere from 1 week to 3 weeks, depending on your background & programming proficiency. After the last step, you will be notified of a decision within a few days, if not the same day.

1. Online Application
2. First Interview
3. Written Application
4. Coding Challenge
5. Pairing Session

## 1. Online Application

Time: 2-10 minutes

The online application is a basic form from which the admissions team can learn about your background. You can find it here: http://mks.io/immersive-application

## 2. First Interview

Time: 30-45 minutes, via Skype or In-Person

##### What's it like?

It's a very casual conversation where you get a chance to ask anything you want about MakerSquare, and we get a chance to really understand why you want to become a software developer. It's usually 30-45 minutes long.

##### What do I need to prepare?

Prepare questions for the admissions team. We're happy to talk about financing, curriculum, instructors, career services, alumni, hiring partners, and anything in-between. We're always open and honest with our advice, recommendations, and feedback.

##### Who will interview me?

Either someone from the admissions team, Amanda and Emily, or one of the founders, Harsh, Shaan, Ravi, or Shehzan.

## 3. Written Application

You'll be given a link to the written application after your first interview. Here are the questions, in case you want to prepare them beforehand.

1. What excites you about a career in web development?
2. What are you passionate about?
3. Tell us why you'd be an ideal MakerSquare student.
4. Tell us about a technology or product that you love.  What do you think it takes to make something like that work?

## 4. Coding Challenge

Time: Variable based on your programming experience.

You can find the Coding Challange towards the end of this GitBook (Chapter 3). You may get a head start on the challenge right now, but the only requirement is that it is completed by the date of your Pairing Session. If it is not completed, do not fret, you will pair program with the instructor and complete it together.

##### What if I can't complete the challenge before my "Pairing Session"?

No worries. Students who do not complete the coding challenge before the Pairing Session have been admitted to MakerSquare. We are more interested in how you think and approach problems, which can be done while solving the coding challenge together with your interviewer.

## 5. Pairing Session

Time: 20 - 45 minutes

You will pair program with an instructor during this time. You will be asked to go over your solution to the coding challenge, or as much of it as you have completed.
