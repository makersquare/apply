## 2. First Interview

Time: 30-45 minutes, via Skype or In-Person

##### What's it like?

It's a very casual conversation where you get a chance to ask anything you want about MakerSquare, and we get a chance to really understand why you want to become a software developer. It's usually 30-45 minutes long.

##### What do I need to prepare?

Prepare questions for the admissions team. We're happy to talk about financing, curriculum, instructors, career services, alumni, hiring partners, and anything in-between. We're always open and honest with our advice, recommendations, and feedback.

##### Who will interview me?

Either someone from the admissions team, Amanda and Emily, or one of the founders, Harsh, Shaan, Ravi, or Shehzan.
