## 4. Take Home Coding Challenge

Time: Variable based on your programming experience.

You can find the Coding Challange towards the end of this GitBook (Chapter 3). You may get a head start on the challenge right now, but the only requirement is that it is completed by the date of your Pairing Session. If it is not completed, do not fret, you will pair program with the instructor and complete it together.

##### What if I can't complete the challenge before my "Technical Interview"?

No worries. Students who do not complete the coding challenge before the Technical Interview have been admitted to MakerSquare. We are more interested in how you think and approach problems, which can be done while solving the coding challenge together with your interviewer.
