# Comments

In Ruby code, you can add comments for yourself or others reading your code to help document what you are trying to accomplish.

```ruby
# This is a comment. Code will not be evaluated in comments.
# "usa".upcase
"ruby".capitalize # This code will be evaluated, but this text after the pound sign won't be.
```

You'll also see comments used in some of the code examples in this lesson to help illustrate the purpose of the code. Sometimes, you'll see `#=>` at the end of a line. By convention, Rubyists use this to indicate what a particular line of code will evaluate to.

```ruby
"usa".upcase #=> "USA"
```
