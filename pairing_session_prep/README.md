# Coding Challenge Prep

This chapter starts from the beginnings of the web and moves towards an understanding of Ruby you will need to complete the coding challenge.

## Material Overview

- [**How does a website work?**](how_the_web_works.md) - To do web programming, you must be at least familiar with how the web works as a whole.
- [**Ruby Fundamentals**](ruby_fundamentals.md) - Our immersive course spends almost no time on Ruby basics. It is essential that you have a basic grasp on how to write Ruby code. This material will help you do that.
- [**The Coding Challenge**](../coding_challenge/README.md) - After you've completed the exercises in Ruby Fundamentals, you can attack this coding challenge. This challenge is to see how well you're able to apply what you've learned about Ruby so far. During your technical interview, we'll go through your code with you and help you make more progress on it.
