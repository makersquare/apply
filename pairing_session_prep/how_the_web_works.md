# How does a website work?

This is a crash course of what happens when you connect to a website in your web browser. We'll go over many parts of the process involved in a single page load, but we won't spend too much time on any one of them. If you're interested in learning more about the specifics of how the internet works, resources for learning more are provided throughout this lesson. You don't have to read those resources, but you should make sure that you understand *at least* the general gist of the pieces involved in *this* lesson before you reach MakerSquare formally--these concepts are fundamental to the way the web works and to many things you'll be creating for the web over the course of this cohort and your career. It's OK if you need to take breaks and revisit; there's a lot of information here!

Let's get started!
