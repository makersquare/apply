# Pulling it together

OK, that was a *lot* of information. Let's recap at a very high level:

1. Web frameworks are powerful programs that run on programming languages which interface with OSes and machine code to interact with the network, *binding to ports* and able to receive data
2. Clients (most often web browsers) *request* information from specific websites at ports using the HTTP model, whose requests get *routed* to web applications
3. Based on the requested information, a web framework will return files as *responses* including optionally interpolated HTML, and then CSS, JS, images, and whatever else is requested

So where does what you'll be learning at MakerSquare fit in?

HTML  - You'll learn how to make your websites have meaningful content.
CSS   - You'll learn how to make them look awesome.
JS    - You'll learn how to make them interactable, fun, and interact with the backend.
Ruby  - You'll learn how to program, deal with logic, solve problems, and integrate various services.
Rails - You'll learn how to utilize powerful software to avoid reinventing the wheel and create custom, interesting, and dynamic applications.

Drink a beer, take a break, and get on to the rest of the coding challenge prep.
